Welcome, this is bank management app, made in java.

To run this project you need to download it, then import database structure which is in repo folder. We used mySQL workbench to menage database. You can find dump (.sql) file in a "database_struct_folder".
There is no need to fill it with any data to get the project work, simply if you run our app just create your new account. All exteral libraries are menaged by maven.

To set database adress, login and password for admin account in workbench use 3 variables that you can find in mySQL_class.java class as below,

To start the program, run it in an IDE from the LoginGUI class. From here, everything should work properly, but if you're having some problems or have no time, there is a graphic documentation below showing how the application works and its possibilities.
