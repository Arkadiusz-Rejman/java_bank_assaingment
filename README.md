Welcome, this is a bank management app made in Java.

To run this project, you need to download it and import the database structure, which is located in the "database_struct_folder" within the repository. We used MySQL Workbench to manage the database. You can find the dump (.sql) file in the mentioned folder. There is no need to populate it with any data for the project to work; simply create your new account when running our app. All external libraries are managed by Maven.

To set the database address, login, and password for the admin account in MySQL Workbench, use the three variables that you can find in the MySQL_class.java class as shown below:

To start the program, run it in an IDE from the LoginGUI class. From here, everything should work properly, but if you're having some problems or have no time, there is a graphic documentation below showing how the application works and its possibilities.
